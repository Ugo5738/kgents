- **Subscription Management:** (Future) Different tiers based on usage or features.

5. Architectural Overview (Microservices)
   The platform will adopt a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, agility, and maintainability. Services will communicate asynchronously via an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) where appropriate.

5.1. Core Microservices
User Service:

Responsibility: User authentication, authorization, profile management.
Technologies: FastAPI, fastapi-users, fastapi-jwt-auth, Supabase (PostgreSQL).
Security: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, RLS.
Agent Management Service:

Responsibility: CRUD operations for agent metadata (name, description, langflow_flow_json), deployment status tracking.
Technologies: FastAPI, Supabase (PostgreSQL).
Security: RLS, input validation.
Tool Registry Service:

Responsibility: Store and manage definitions of custom tools (OpenAPI specs, Python code).
Technologies: FastAPI, Supabase (PostgreSQL).
Security: RLS, secure storage of tool code.
Agent Deployment Service:

Responsibility: Orchestrate the deployment of user-defined Langflow agents to the cloud (containerized or serverless).
Technologies: FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes API client (or cloud SDKs for serverless), potentially a message queue for async deployment tasks.
Security: Secure execution environment for agents, resource isolation.
Agent Runtime Service:

Responsibility: Host and execute deployed user agents. This will be a scalable pool of containers/serverless functions.
Technologies: Docker, Kubernetes/Cloud Functions, Langflow runtime (headless mode), LLM APIs, Supabase (for agent memory).
Security: Sandboxing for tool execution, network isolation, content filtering.
Observability & Monitoring Service:

Responsibility: Collect logs, traces, and metrics from all other services and deployed agents. Provide a unified view.
Technologies: FastAPI (for receiving webhooks/data), LangSmith/Langfuse SDKs, Prometheus/Grafana (or cloud-native monitoring solutions).
Natural Language Agent Creation Service:

Responsibility: Interpret natural language descriptions and generate/refine Langflow flow JSON.
Technologies: FastAPI, LLM APIs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3), LangChain/AutoGen (for parsing/generation logic).
5.2. Data Flow & Communication
API Gateway: All external requests will go through an API Gateway for routing, authentication, rate limiting, and WAF protection.
Synchronous Communication: RESTful APIs for direct requests between services (e.g., User Service calling Agent Management Service).
Asynchronous Communication (EDA): Message queues/brokers (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or cloud-native equivalents like AWS SQS/SNS, Google Pub/Sub, Azure Service Bus) for event-driven workflows (e.g., Agent Management Service publishing an "AgentPublished" event, which the Agent Deployment Service consumes).
Agent-to-Agent Communication: Leverage Langflow's native MCP support and explore A2A protocol for inter-agent collaboration.

### 5.5. Frontend (Langflow)

- **Do we need to clone Langflow?**
  - **No, not necessarily for the initial build and deployment.** Langflow can be run as a Docker container (`langflowai/langflow:latest`).[1, 2] This is the fastest way to get it running. You can then integrate your FastAPI backend with Langflow's API.[3, 4]
  - **You _would_ clone Langflow if:**
    - You need to deeply customize Langflow's core UI or add highly specialized components that aren't possible via its custom component feature.[5, 6]
    - You want to contribute directly to Langflow's codebase.
  - **Recommendation:** Start by running the official Langflow Docker image. This minimizes setup time and maintenance. If deep customization of Langflow's internal workings becomes a bottleneck later, then consider cloning and modifying.

### 5.6. Deployment Strategy

- **Platform Services (FastAPI, Langflow IDE):** Containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes (e.g., AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS). This provides robust scaling, reliability, and fine-grained control.[7, 8, 9]
- **User Agents (Agent Runtime Service):**
  - **Simple/Stateless Agents:** Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions/Run, Azure Functions) for cost-efficiency and auto-scaling.[7, 10, 11, 12, 13]
  - **Complex/Stateful/Multi-Agent Systems:** Dedicated containers/pods within Kubernetes for more control, custom dependencies, and long-running tasks.[7, 8, 9]
- **Supabase:** Managed cloud service for database.

## 6. Security Checklist Integration

The security checklist items will be integrated throughout the development process:

- **Rate Limit All API Endpoints:** Implemented in the FastAPI backend using `fastapi-limiter` middleware.
- **Use Row Level Security (RLS) Always:** Configured directly in Supabase for `users`, `agents`, `tools`, and `agent_memories` tables. This is critical for multi-tenancy.
- **CAPTCHA on All Auth Routes/Signup Pages:** Integrated into the FastAPI `auth` service.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Enabled at the cloud provider level (e.g., AWS WAF, Cloudflare, Azure Application Gateway) for the API Gateway and Langflow frontend.
- **Test Automation for High-Cost-of-Failure Areas:** Dedicated `pytest` suites for payment, subscription, and usage tracking logic (when implemented).
- **Third-Party Integration Tests:** When integrating LLM APIs or other services, tests will explicitly validate against official documentation and examples.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Pydantic models in FastAPI will enforce strict input validation. LLM inputs will undergo additional sanitization and prompt injection prevention techniques (e.g., content filters, guardrails).
- **Secure Code Execution:** Custom tool code (Python) will be executed in isolated Docker containers or serverless functions with strict resource limits and no network access unless explicitly required and audited.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based authentication (`fastapi-jwt-auth`) for API access. Fine-grained authorization logic within FastAPI services based on user roles and resource ownership.
- **Data Encryption:** TLS/HTTPS for all API communication. Supabase handles encryption at rest.
- **Secret Management:** Environment variables for local development. Cloud-native secret management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) for production.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Plan for periodic penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
- **Least Privilege:** All microservices, containers, and cloud functions will be configured with the minimum necessary IAM roles and permissions.
